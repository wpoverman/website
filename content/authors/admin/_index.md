#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm a PhD student at Stanford Graduate School of Business in the Operations, Information, and Technology group. My research interests span machine learning, experimentation, and healthcare, with a focus on alignment, uncertainy quantification, reinforcement learning (RL), network interference in experiments, and prediction models in healthcare operations and clinical settings. I have interned at Uber, where I applied my research in RL and experimentation to large-scale problems.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Caltech, double majoring in mathematics and computer science, with a focus on combinatorics and complexity theory. After graduating in Spring 2020, I spent most of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea as a visiting researcher at the Institute for Basic Science. During this time, I also obtained a master's degree in computer science from UC Irvine, focusing on research in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
